#Simple Build - ES6 + SCSS

Lightweight scaffolding and build tool to quickly and easily integrate a ES6 and SCSS.

  - transpiles scss into css
  - transpiles es6 nto es5
  - concatenates all required/imported modules together into a `dist/` directory

##Getting started

  - **starting inside the root of the project-directory** clone this repo with `git clone git@github.com:t3tools/simple-build-es6-scss.git «your-project-name»`
  - disconnect from my remote repo and point to your own
    - `git remote remove origin`
    - `git remote add origin «url-to-your-repo»`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run go`
  - that's it! open the `index.html` file and see your changes

##Workflow
  - all assets (CSS, JS, and images) are served from the `/dist` folder
  - you'll *only* write CSS and JS code in the files in the `/src` folder

##Publishing
  - add, commit and push per usual
